# Smart speakers & privacy choices

## Summary

This page summarizes my work on my final project for Telling Stories with Data, Spring 2020. I use existing data to describe users' attitudes towards smart speakers, especially what we know about their privacy concerns, and I also describe data I collected from these devices and their accompanying smartphone apps to assess the usability of their privacy controls.

In short: these devices are increasingly popular, but people are also increasingly worried about their privacy implications, and there's a lot of room for improvement on the usability of their privacy controls!
