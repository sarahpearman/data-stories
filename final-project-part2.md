# User Research Plan

I used the following **script** for my user interviews:
* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?
* What parts were confusing?
* What parts were most informative?
* Was there any information you thought was missing?
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart)
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?

My **target audience** is people who are interested in privacy research (including people who might want to fund research on this topic). These are people who likely don't need to be convinced that this type of research is important and who have some experience with data, but they are not necessarily experts in my exact subfield, so ideally this will also be very accessible to a broader audience that does not have a great deal of knowledge about privacy research or data visualization.

I tested this storyboard with three people, iterating each time. I **chose individuals to interview** as follows:
* The first interviewee is very similar to the target audience and has a similar background to me. I knew she would be most likely to understand and be able to give useful feedback on the roughest version of this.
* The second interviewee is not a researcher or data visualization expert but is familiar enough with my research area to understand what I'm trying to do, and he has expertise in a visual field, so his design sense is useful.
* The third interviewee does not have expertise related to privacy research or data visualization and is not as familiar with my current research goals, so his feedback is useful as an example of a broader target audience.


# Round 1

## Storyboard v1

My initial storyboard with wireframes of the relevant charts was built in Balsamiq and is shown below.

## User 1

My first interview was conducted remotely with a person who would be considered the desired audience for this storyboard: a fellow privacy researcher with a background similar to mine. She has also taken this course.

Paraphrased notes from this interview:

* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?: **"Smart speakers are a huge deal but there are concerns about privacy."**
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?: **Privacy researchers**
* What parts were confusing?: **The last two graphs**
* What parts were most informative? **Really liked the trend graph, also liked the pie charts**
* Was there any information you thought was missing?: **N/A**
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?: **"The claim that "clearly plenty of people think that they are useful" threw me off because I was like, well... maybe it was just the hype, not usefulness that drove it, which then distracted me from the rest of the content for a little while."**
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?: **"They meant what are the things that the different speakers can understand if they give a good reply. I noted some suggestions above, but I also think it might be worth being more verbose, like : Can Alexa and Google Home understand what you said? (and then clear yes/no) Can you understand their response? (yes/no, if you are going to say what they say e.g. "go to url" etc then have it be "And what do they say?")"**
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart): **"how hard/easy to access the information it is, both in steps and in readability. You could try some infographic-y visualizations, separating the two variables. E.g. have stairs for both, with the steps one clearly counting steps, and the other one indicating degree or school progression (I don't expect most people to know the Flesch-Kincaid scale). I also didn't notice/figure out why there were different icons until I actually looked for it, so maybe find a different way to represent that information?..."**
* Do you have any other questions or feedback? **Liked the topic. Suggested a less generic final call to action, since "more research is needed... is pretty standard"**

# Round 2

## Storyboard v2

I made the following changes based on feedback from the first interview:
* Added title to 2nd-to-last graph
* Changed title and subtitle to clarify last graph
* Made call to action more specific

I plan to make more changes, but I wanted to get more feedback on what method of presenting the last two graphs might work best. This was easier to do with the second interviewee since that interview happened in person.

## User 2

* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?
* What parts were confusing?
* What parts were most informative?
* Was there any information you thought was missing?
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart)
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?
