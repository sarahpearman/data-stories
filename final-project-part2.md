# User Research Plan

I used the following **script** for my user interviews:
* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?
* What parts were confusing?
* What parts were most informative?
* Was there any information you thought was missing?
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart)
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?

My **target audience** is people who are interested in privacy research (including people who might want to fund research on this topic). These are people who likely don't need to be convinced that this type of research is important and who have some experience with data, but they are not necessarily experts in my exact subfield, so ideally this will also be very accessible to a broader audience that does not have a great deal of knowledge about privacy research or data visualization.

I tested this storyboard with three people, iterating each time. I **chose individuals to interview** as follows:
* The first interviewee is very similar to the target audience and has a similar background to me. I knew she would be most likely to understand and be able to give useful feedback on the roughest version of this.
* The second interviewee is not a researcher or data visualization expert but is familiar enough with my research area to understand what I'm trying to do, and he has expertise in a visual field, so his design sense is useful.
* The third interviewee does not have expertise related to privacy research or data visualization and is not as familiar with my current research goals, so his feedback is useful as an example of a broader target audience.


# Round 1

My initial storyboard with wireframes of the relevant charts was built in Balsamiq and is shown below.

## Storyboard v1

![storyboard1](https://github.com/sarahpearman/data-stories/blob/master/final-project-files/storyboards/wireframe1-1.png)


## User 1

My first interview was conducted remotely with a person who would be considered the desired audience for this storyboard: a fellow privacy researcher with a background similar to mine. She has also taken this course.

Paraphrased notes from this interview:

* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?: **"Smart speakers are a huge deal but there are concerns about privacy."**
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?: **Privacy researchers**
* What parts were confusing?: **The last two graphs**
* What parts were most informative? **Really liked the trend graph, also liked the pie charts**
* Was there any information you thought was missing?: **N/A**
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?: **"The claim that "clearly plenty of people think that they are useful" threw me off because I was like, well... maybe it was just the hype, not usefulness that drove it, which then distracted me from the rest of the content for a little while."**
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?: **"They meant what are the things that the different speakers can understand if they give a good reply. I noted some suggestions above, but I also think it might be worth being more verbose, like : Can Alexa and Google Home understand what you said? (and then clear yes/no) Can you understand their response? (yes/no, if you are going to say what they say e.g. "go to url" etc then have it be "And what do they say?")"**
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart): **"how hard/easy to access the information it is, both in steps and in readability. You could try some infographic-y visualizations, separating the two variables. E.g. have stairs for both, with the steps one clearly counting steps, and the other one indicating degree or school progression (I don't expect most people to know the Flesch-Kincaid scale). I also didn't notice/figure out why there were different icons until I actually looked for it, so maybe find a different way to represent that information?..."**
* Do you have any other questions or feedback? **Liked the topic. Suggested a less generic final call to action, since "more research is needed... is pretty standard"**

# Round 2

I made the following changes based on feedback from the first interview:
* Added title to 2nd-to-last graph
* Changed title and subtitle to clarify last graph
* Made call to action more specific

I knew I would make more changes as well, but I wanted to get more feedback on what method of presenting the last two graphs might work best. This was easier to do with the second interviewee since that interview happened in person.

## Storyboard v2

![storyboard2](https://github.com/sarahpearman/data-stories/blob/master/final-project-files/storyboards/wireframe2.png)

## User 2

Paraphrased feedback from User 2:
* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?: **"Smart speakers are recording info; it's not clear or easy to disable that"**
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?: **People who own smart speakers**
* What parts were confusing?: **Generally clear, but last 2 charts could be clearer**
* What parts were most informative?: **Thought the last chart was the most interesting, especially that Apple seems most privacy-friendly in having the setting for saving recordings off by default but also has the most complex language to explain the setting**
* Was there any information you thought was missing?: **No**
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?: **See below**
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?: **(We talked about this one for a while, and the conclusion was ultimately that there should not be two columns per product and that the "Understands" column could be removed without losing meaning)**
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart): **(We also talked about this one for a while. He did not like the corner labels and suggested removing those. Said he didn't like "labels that try to help you interpret a graph" and just preferred clearly-labeled axes. Also said it was not clear what "grade level" meant and that the axis label and tick mark labels would need to be clarified for an audience that didn't know what a Flesch-Kincaid score was. In particular, since "grade 14" isn't really meaningful, he said it would be useful to add more context with labels like "elementary school level" and "college level.")**
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?: **No**

# Round 3

Based on the feedback from User 2, I made the following changes:
* 2nd-to-last chart:
  * Removed superfluous column of information
  * Clearer title (hopefully)
  * Explanatory legend for X symbol
* Readability chart:
  * Added additional reference line to contextualize what grade level meant for users not familiar with Flesch-Kincaid (especially to explain why the y-axis on that graph can go up to 14)
  * Changed legend title
  * Got rid of colors/legend for product variable
  * Removed corner labels that User 2 thought were unnecessary/confusing
  * X-axis no longer truncated (starts at 1 instead of 4)

## Storyboard v3

![storyboard3](https://github.com/sarahpearman/data-stories/blob/master/final-project-files/storyboards/wireframe3.png)

## User 3

Paraphrased feedback from User 3:
* If you had to describe in a couple of sentences what the message of this presentation was, what would you say?: **People are confused about privacy stuff with smart speakers / don't understand it, in part because it's deliberately made hard to find**
* Who do you think is the intended audience for this presentation?: **Relatively educated audience, used to reading about technology and looking at charts, but not necessarily experts. Gave the example of a publication like the Economist. At least high school graduate**
* What parts were confusing?: **The last chart**
* What parts were most informative?: **Liked 2nd-to-last chart**
* Was there any information you thought was missing?: **No**
* Was there any information that seemed unnecessary or distracting?: **The format of the last graph**
* What did the 2nd-to-last chart with the Xs and check marks mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer?: **Liked this one, understood that it meant that the smart speakers couldn't directly engage in conversation about their own privacy attributes**
* What did the last chart mean to you? Would you suggest any changes to make it clearer? (The readability chart): **Thought it was confusing to have these two variables plotted against each other like this since they aren't directly related / because it's not trying to show a correlation. Suggested a few other types of graph that might be more intuitive.**
* Do you have any other questions or feedback?: **No**

## Final Storyboard

![final storyboard](https://github.com/sarahpearman/data-stories/blob/master/final-project-files/storyboards/final-wireframe.png)

My tentative final storyboard shown above is Storyboard 3 without any major changes, but I still want to think more about whether there is a better way to show the final chart, since I got mixed feedback about it. I drafted the chart below based on some suggestions from User 3, but I'm not sure it's any clearer, and I didn't come up with any other ideas that seem worth testing yet, but I'll brainstorm more and see if I can come up with anything before the final version of this project.
