# More and more people are putting smart speakers in their homes, but people still aren't sure whether they can trust these devices.

## Outline

I plan to tell a story about how adoption of smart speakers (e.g., Alexa devices) is increasing, while trust in their privacy practices does not seem to be increasing accordingly. I will use public Pew Research data from 2017 and 2019 that includes general adoption percentages for these devices as well as questions about people's usage of these devices and opinions about them. I may also use some other research data and news reports, depending on what I am able to scrape, but the Pew datasets will be my main source since they are public.

This will be useful for me in the future: I'm interested in conducting further research on data use disclosures and consent interfaces in voice user interfaces such as smart speakers and phone voice assistants. I will need to be able to succinctly tell a story of why we might want to conduct that type of research.

### Setup

Adoption of smart speakers and voice assistants is growing. Pew Research found that nearly half of Americans surveyed used voice assistants in May 2017, and 17% on a standalone device such as an Amazon Echo [topline data here](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/voice-assistants-TOPLINE-and-METHODOLOGY-FINAL-COPY-EDITED.pdf). About two years later, in their June 2019 American Trends Panel, Pew found that 25% of households surveyed had standalone voice assistant devices [topline data here](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FT_19.11.21_SmartSpeaker_methods-topline-final-11.21.pdf).

### Conflict

Many people don't trust these devices (including some who own them), and people who own them and do trust them sometimes have fundamental misunderstandings of what may be happening with their data.

### Resolution

The research and best practices on designing for usability and privacy in voice user interfaces needs to catch up to the surge of research on natural language processing and conversational agents. 

In the meantime, regular users should take note of whether these devices are using their data in ways they are comfortable with. Users can consider this when deciding what they do and do not want to purchase, and they can also choose to change the privacy settings on their devices from the defaults if they want more control over how their data is used.

## Initial sketches

## The data

My main data sources will be two sets of Pew Research survey results.

The first comes from the May 2017 American Trends Panel (Wave 27). That dataset is publicly available in full [from this list](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/datasets/) with a free Pew Research account, but it can't be directly linked since signin is required to download the raw datasets from their website. The topline report for the relevant data is also available [here]().

The second source comes from the June 2019 American Trends Panel (Wave 35). The full raw dataset is not yet available (Pew usually has a delay of up to 1-2 years from collection to release of the full dataset), but the topline data contains what I need, and it's available [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FT_19.11.21_SmartSpeaker_methods-topline-final-11.21.pdf). The parts I'm concerned with are also summarized in a report [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/21/5-things-to-know-about-americans-and-their-smart-speakers/).

Both of these datasets consist of >4000 U.S. adults who are randomly selected from the general population.

### Possible supplementary data sources

I am also exploring other context that may be useful, including statistics cited in academic papers and news publications listed below. In those cases, the full data may not be available, but the simple percentages and counts that I need can be taken directly from the publications.

## Method and medium

I plan to complete the final "story" for my project using Shorthand.

Most of my visuals will likely be built using ggplot, since that's what I'm most familiar with, but I expect to build some of the visualizations using Tableau or other tools introduced in the class where possible.
