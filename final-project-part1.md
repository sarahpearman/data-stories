# More and more people are putting smart speakers in their homes, but people still aren't sure whether they can trust these devices.

## Outline

*The outline of your final project should serve as the building blocks for the rest of your presentation.  You've been introduced to Shorthand (Links to an external site.), one option you have at your disposal for creating your final project deliverable.  Shorthand also has a handy template you can reference for creating an outline of your project*

*At a minimum, you should include the following:*

* *A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.*

* *A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories.*

## Initial sketches

## The data

*At a minimum, you should include the following:*

* *A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

* *A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.*

## Method and medium

*In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story.*

*Finally, for your final project I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.*
