# More and more people are putting smart speakers in their homes, but people still aren't sure whether they can trust these devices.

## Outline

I plan to tell a story about how adoption of smart speakers (e.g., Alexa devices) is increasing, while trust in their privacy practices does not seem to be increasing accordingly. I will use public Pew Research data from 2017 and 2019 that includes general adoption percentages for these devices as well as questions about people's usage of these devices and opinions about them. I may also use some other research data and news reports, depending on what I am able to scrape, but the Pew datasets will be my main source since they are public.

This will be useful for me in the future: I'm interested in conducting further research on data use disclosures and consent interfaces in voice user interfaces such as smart speakers and phone voice assistants. I will need to be able to succinctly tell a story of why we might want to conduct that type of research.

*A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories.*

### Setup

Adoption of smart speakers and voice assistants is growing.

### Conflict

Many people don't trust these devices (including some who own them), and people who own them and do trust them sometimes have fundamental misunderstandings of what may be happening with their data.

### Resolution

The research and best practices on designing for usability and privacy in voice user interfaces needs to catch up to the surge of research on natural language processing and conversational agents. 

In the meantime, regular users should take note of whether these devices are using their data in ways they are comfortable with. Users can consider this when deciding what they do and do not want to purchase, and they can also choose to change the privacy settings on their devices from the defaults if they want more control over how their data is used.

## Initial sketches

## The data

*At a minimum, you should include the following:*

* *A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

* *A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.*

## Method and medium

*In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story.*

*Finally, for your final project I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.*
