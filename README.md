# About me

Hello! My name is Sarah Pearman (she/her/hers). I'm a PhD student in Societal Computing. I do research on usable privacy and security issues (how to make password authentication easier to use, for example, or how to design services and devices so that normal people can actually make informed decisions about how their data will be used).

# What I hope to learn

As a researcher, I work with a lot of data and often need to visualize it, but I don't have a design background, so I always know my visualizations could be better! Especially as a person who is advocating for other people's products to be usable--including presented in visually intuitive ways--I feel like it's important for my own data visualizations to be "usable."

I will almost certainly be a researcher of some kind after graduation, and I think it's most likely that I will take an industry job doing user research. Whether I'm in industry or academia, I will always have data that I need to explain to other people. Research isn't worth much if you can't help other people understand and apply your findings.

# Dog!

This picture of my dog was here as a placeholder originally, but who's mad about an unsolicited dog photo?
